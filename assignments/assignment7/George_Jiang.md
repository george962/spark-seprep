### I ran the Chatbot

Here is my Chatbot Screenshot

#### What went well

The chatbot was responsive and it answered my questions correctly. It was a smooth and seamless interaction.

#### What didn't go well

The chat did give me relatively long answers by default. Oftentimes, I didn't read the entirety of the response outputed by the chat bot.
